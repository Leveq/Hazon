# Screenplay Formatting Guide

This guide defines the standard formatting conventions for screenplays based on industry standards (similar to Final Draft formatting).

- **Page Length**: ~1 page = ~1 minute of screen time

## Script Elements

### 1. SCENE HEADING (Slug Line)

```

### 3. CHARACTER NAME

- **Margin**: 3.7 inches from left edge
- **Spacing**: Double-space before, single-space after
- **Extensions** (in parentheses after name):
  - `(V.O.)` - Voice Over (narration not from scene)
  - `(O.S.)` - Off Screen (in scene but not visible)
  - `(O.C.)` - Off Camera (same as O.S.)
  - `(CONT'D)` - Continued (when dialogue continues after action)

          Hmm. This looks new.
```

### 5. PARENTHETICAL (Wrylies)
- **Format**: Lowercase in parentheses, centered under character name
- **Margin**: 3.1 inches from left edge
- **Usage**: Brief acting/delivery instructions only
- **Rules**:

                    DISGUST
                (sarcastic)
          That is not brightly colored or 
          shaped like a dinosaur...
  
                    YOUNG RILEY
                (excited)
          Yucky!
```

### 6. TRANSITIONS
- **Format**: ALL CAPS, right-aligned
- **Margin**: Right edge of page
- **Common Transitions**:
  - `CUT TO:`
  - `FADE TO:`
  - `DISSOLVE TO:`
  - `MATCH CUT TO:`
  - `SMASH CUT TO:`
- **Usage**: Use sparingly; only when necessary to clarify timing/style
- **Note**: Most modern screenplays omit transitions except for specific stylistic choices

### 7. ON THE SCREEN / SPECIAL FORMATTING
- **Format**: ALL CAPS when introducing new visual element
- **Usage**: For TV screens, monitors, text messages, titles, etc.
- **Example**:
```
  ON THE SCREEN: a spoonful of broccoli.
  
  DISGUST enters.
```

### 8. MONTAGE
- **Format**:
```

  Brief description.
  
  B) EXT. ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT
  
  Brief description.
  
  END MONTAGE.
```

### 9. INTERCUT
- **Format**: Used when cutting between two simultaneous scenes
- **Example**:
```
  INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION
  
  INT. APARTMENT - DAY
  
  Character A speaks.
  
  INT. OFFICE - DAY
  
  Character B responds.
```

## Special Formatting Cases

### Flashbacks
```
FLASHBACK:

INT. LOCATION - DAY (YEAR)

Description and dialogue.

BACK TO PRESENT
```

### Title Cards/Supers
```
SUPER: "New York City, 1985"
```

### Emphasis in Dialogue
- Use italics sparingly for emphasized words
- Never use bold or underline in dialogue
- Example:
```
                    CHARACTER
          I *never* said that!
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't use camera directions** (CLOSE UP, ANGLE ON, etc.) unless you're directing
2. **Don't number scenes** in spec scripts (only shooting scripts)
3. **Don't use ellipses (...)** excessively in dialogue
4. **Don't overuse CAPS** in action lines
5. **Don't write "we see"** or "we hear" (just describe what happens)
6. **Don't include act breaks** in feature films (TV only)
7. **Don't use parentheticals** for action (put it in action lines)

## Dialogue Best Practices

1. **Subtext over text**: Characters should want something, not just exchange information
2. **Interruptions**: Use em-dashes (--) for abrupt interruptions
3. **Trailing off**: Use ellipses (...) when character trails off
4. **Overlapping dialogue**: 
```
                    CHARACTER A
          I think we should--
   
                    CHARACTER B
          --No way. Not happening.
```

## Formatting for Different Media

### TV Screenplay Differences
- Include `TEASER`, `ACT ONE`, `ACT TWO`, etc.
- Use `END OF ACT ONE` before commercial breaks
- Include `END OF SHOW` at the end
- May use `FADE IN:` at beginning and `FADE OUT.` at end

### Feature Film
- `FADE IN:` at beginning (optional in modern scripts)
- `FADE OUT.` only at the very end
- No act breaks

**When in doubt, keep it simple and visual. Write what we see and hear, not what characters think or feel internally.**
