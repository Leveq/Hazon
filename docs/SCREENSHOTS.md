# Screenshots

Add your app screenshots here for the README.

## Suggested screenshots:
1. `screenshot.png` - Main editor view showing screenplay formatting
2. `dark-mode.png` - App in dark mode
3. `characters-panel.png` - Character management sidebar
4. `landing-page.png` - Home screen with recent scripts

## How to take good screenshots:
- Use a clean, sample script (run `npm run seed` to get sample data)
- Show the app at a reasonable window size (1280x800 works well)
- Capture both light and dark modes
- On Windows: Win+Shift+S for screenshot tool
- On macOS: Cmd+Shift+4 for selection capture
